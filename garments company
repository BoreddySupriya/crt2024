Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer num0fMots, representing the number of plots shortlisted by the company for outlets (N). The second line consists of N space-separated integers – areal, areal, ….., areaN representing the area of the N plots selected for outlets.

Constraints

0 < num0fPlots < 10^6 0 < area < 10^6 0 < i < num0fPlots

Output Format

Print an integer representing the number of plots that will be selected for outlets.
